				<h1 class="display-3">Welcome!</h1>
				<p class="lead">This is a Timetable App I built as an educational project for the
					<a href="https://foxminded.com.ua/ua/java/" target="_blank">Foxminded Java EE course</a>.</p>
				<p class="text-warning">Start exploring: hit the logo in the top left corner to select a use case.</p>

				<h4 class="text-muted">Set-up</h4>
				<p>App reads 20 first, 20 last names, and 10 courses from txt files and randomly generates a university
					model with (currently) 300 students grouped by 30, 5 professors, 10 courses, and 5
					auditoriums. Professor-courses are randomly assigned with max 2 professors per course and 4 courses per
					professor. App also generates a random schedule where:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						All groups take all courses
					</li>
					<li>
						Schedule cycles every two weeks
					</li>
					<li>
						Courses are taught Mon-Fri
					</li>
					<li>
						Each day is divided into 5 periods
					</li>
					<li>
						Semester runs September 7 - December 11, 2020 (14 weeks)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Timetable itself is organized in a way that ony two-week cycle of schedule templates is generated on startup.
					Those templates are later used to generate schedule items for specific dates upon request. If schedule
					items have already been created in the course of user interaction they are retrieved from the database. This
					set-up allows the following flexibility:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Entire semester schedule is <em>not generated on startup</em> but rather on "as-needed" basis
					</li>
					<li>
						Courses can be <em>rescheduled once</em> per occurrence in which case same course in the next cycle will be
						generated from the unchanged template
					</li>
					<li>
						<em>Permanent rescheduling</em> is made easy: all it takes is updating a template (with any existing linked
						schedule items). All further schedule items generated from amended template will reflect the change
					</li>
				</ul>
				<hr class="my-4">
				<h4 class="text-muted">Use cases</h4>
				<p>Students can view:</p>
